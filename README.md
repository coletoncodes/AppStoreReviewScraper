# AppStoreReviewScraper

This is a simple python script that will scrape an amount of  reviews for a given App's App Store URL. 

It will create a new CSV file for the app's reviews and from there you can do what you wish with the CSV. 

Please note the url must be in this format: 


https://apps.apple.com/APP_COUNTRY/app/APP_NAME/APP_ID'


This isn't a project I spent a lot of time with, so feel free to Fork and do with as you wish. This is just a starting point.

Sometimes the script won't pull the requested amount of reviews, so keep that in mind. 

I'm using a [3rd-party library explained here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-python-to-scrape-app-store-reviews/)
